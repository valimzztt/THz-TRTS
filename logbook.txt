Instead of running it as directly 3 averages, we ran three separate full 2D scans (to prevent the scan to fail due to insufficient liquid nytrogen)

The temperature has been very stable for the entire scan, no fluctuations

When the heater was at 10%, I had to open the valve to let more cryogenic in , so the scan of Average1 1847 will be affected (namely the last few data points), where the pump is at 95.3250 and first seconds of 1857 file (pump is at 95.3175)

Throughout the rest of the scan, the cryostat has never been touched, stable temperature

During the third scan, there was a CW breakthrough: Rodrigo and Ben had to close the Pockel cells for a few seconds, this was done when there was almost no THz signal
Rodrigo has the picture of which scan and pump delay was affected by this
